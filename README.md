# Deconstruction Ontology (DCO)

The **Deconstruction Ontology (DCO)** is a structured ontology designed to represent the fundamental concepts and processes involved in deconstruction projects. It primarily focuses on the **planning and execution** of building deconstruction while incorporating essential aspects such as various **deconstruction procedures**, the **materials** and **hazardous substances** involved, as well as the machinery and equipment used in the process. Additionally, the ontology defines the roles and qualifications required for personnel and includes key considerations regarding **health and safety** measures in deconstruction projects.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose
The goal of the DCO is to provide a standardized framework that enhances the **understanding, communication, and digital representation** of deconstruction activities. It can be used for **data integration, knowledge management, and decision-making support** in deconstruction projects.
